## 📖 Introduction

_**Cryptographic Roots of Trust for Open Source Development**_

[![Project Status: Active](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

**Open Integrity** is an initiative by [Blockchain Commons](https://www.blockchaincommons.com) to integrate cryptographic trust mechanisms into Git repositories. By leveraging Git's native SSH signing capabilities and structured verification processes, we ensure transparency, provenance, and immutability for software projects.

Whether you're a developer, security researcher, or open-source maintainer, Open Integrity provides the tools to:
- Provide a **developer-friendly framework** for cryptographic integrity.
- Establish **verifiable proof-of-origin** for commits and code artifacts through direct verification by inception key holder.
- Expand that proof-of-origin through a **chain of trust** that allows delegated verification of authorized signers.
- Detect **tampering or unauthorized modifications** in repository history.
- Enable **cross-platform trust verification** across Git hosting services

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 🛡 **Immutable Proof-of-Origin** – Verify the authenticity of software artifacts
- 🔏 **Signed Commits & Tags** – Ensure authorship integrity through SSH signatures (~128-bit security).
- 🔍 **Tamper Detection** – Maintain verifiable repository history.
- 🔗 **Trust Delegation** – Enable controlled transition from inception key to authorized signers.
- 🌍 **Platform-Agnostic Validation** – Work across GitHub, GitLab, and self-hosted solutions.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Inception Commits** – Immutable starting points that combine:
  - Empty commit for SHA-1 collision resistance
  - Ricardian Contract defining trust rules
  - SSH signature providing strong cryptographic proofs
- **Trust Models**:
  - Direct inception key verification
  - Delegated verification through authorized signers
- **Automated Tamper Detection** – Integrity checks throughout history
- **Audit Tools** – Comprehensive repository inspection
- **Cross-Platform Trust** – GitHub, GitLab, P2P, or self-hosted support

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow the [Getting Started Guide](Open_Integrity_Getting-Started.md) to:
1. Set up your development environment for signing
2. Create a repository with an inception commit establishing your root of trust
3. Choose your trust model:
   - Direct verification using the inception key
   - OR delegated verification through authorized signers
4. Run Open Integrity audits on your repositories

For a deeper dive, check out our [Problem Statement](Open_Integrity_Problem_Statement.md) and **[Architecture Overview](Open_Integrity_Architecture.md)**.

## 🚦 Project Status & Roadmap

### **Current Phase: Early Research & Proof-of-Concept (v0.1.0)**
🔹 Core concepts & initial implementation complete
🔹 Seeking community feedback for improvements
🔹 Developing integration with CI/CD & key management solutions
🔹 **Not yet production-ready**

📍 See our [Development Phases](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/blob/master/release-path.md) for the full roadmap.

## ❗ Issue Management

We recommend starting general issues in GitHub's 💬 [Community Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/OpenIntegrityProject/discussions) to encourage open dialogue before they are formally moved to our ❗ [Initial Issue Tracker](https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/community/issues). 

However, in alignment with our commitment to decentralized repository management, we plan to develop GitHub Action scripts that will automatically populate `/issues/` directories within each repository. This will allow issues to be mirrored across multiple Git hosting platforms, ensuring greater resilience and accessibility beyond GitHub.
